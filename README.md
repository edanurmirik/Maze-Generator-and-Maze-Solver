#  Robot Project

This project is a maze-solving simulation developed using the Java programming language. The project is designed to reinforce knowledge of object-oriented programming and data structures. By working on two different problems, the practical application of algorithms is demonstrated.

##  Features

-  **Problem 1:**  
  - Reads maze data from an external URL.
  - Finds the shortest path between the start and end points using the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm.
  - Visually displays obstacles and paths on the map.

-  **Problem 2:**  
  - Generates a maze of random size.
  - Finds a solution path between the start and end points using the Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm.
  - Shows visited and unvisited paths in different colors.

-  **Optimization**:  
  - Visualizes the differences between DFS and BFS algorithms.
  - Analyzes the solution path and visited paths in randomly generated mazes.

## Technologies 

The project is developed using Java. For the Graphical User Interface (GUI), Swing is used to create a user-friendly interface to visualize the maze and the solving process. The project follows the principles of Object-Oriented Programming, utilizing concepts like classes and inheritance to structure the code efficiently. Additionally, various data structures such as Stack, Queue, and ArrayList are employed to handle the maze traversal algorithms and store the necessary data during the solving process.
